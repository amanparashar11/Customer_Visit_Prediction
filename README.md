# Customer_Visit_Prediction


Problem Statement: The objective of this project was to build and evaluate the performance of five classification models (LR, LDA, RF, SVM, and Decision trees) in R 
to predict whether a customer is likely to visit the store again. 
The dataset used for this analysis contained imbalanced data, requiring the implementation of appropriate techniques to address the issue. 
To showcase the logic and thought process behind the project, a detailed report.pdf was prepared.
